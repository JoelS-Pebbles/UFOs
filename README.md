# UFOs

## Overview of project:
More filters have been added to be able to search for UFO sightings with more accuracy. The filters that were added are , city, state, country and shape. 

## Results
There are a total of five filters to search for the UFO sightings that have been recorded. In the filters type the criteria you want to search for and press enter. The table will populate if there are sightings that match the criteria you put in. If there is no data, the page will just be blank. Below is a picture of all of the sightings that happened in Texas:
