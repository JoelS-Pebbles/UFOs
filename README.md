# UFOs

## Overview of project:
More filters have been added to be able to search for UFO sightings with more accuracy. The filters that were added are , city, state, country and shape. 

## Results
There are a total of five filters to search for the UFO sightings that have been recorded. In the filters type the criteria you want to search for and press enter. The table will populate if there are sightings that match the criteria you put in. If there is no data, the page will just be blank. Below is a picture of all of the sightings that happened in Texas:

## Summary
One drawback of the new webpage is that there is not a filter button so users could get confused on how to use the filters. All they need to do is type the crtieria they want and press enter but that is not clear so there could be some confusion there. A recomendation is to add a "Go" button once the filters have been added. One other addition that would be helpful is to have a button that would clear the filter fields to their placeholders.
